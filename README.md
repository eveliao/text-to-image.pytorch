# text-to-image in PyTorch

[WIP]

This repository is for implementation of [Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05396) in pytorch. 
In stage1, model generate 64x64 images and stage2 model generate 256x256 images with given 64x64 images (However no VAE-tricks are used).
